# Chinese Text Tools

These are some tools I've written in the processing of trying to learn Mandarin.

## Usage

Uses python 2. `python setup.py install` to install.

## Tools

* zhsegment: Determines the word boundaries in a given chinese text and outputs that text with the words separated by spaces.
* zhwordcounts: Using the same word segmentation algorithm, outputs the most common words in a given text, along with the number of times they occur.
